# Content Audit Log Feature

Leverage the content audit log feature if you would like to see updates being made to your collection and by whom. 

Disclaimer: If you are not the author or a collaborator of the collection, then you will not see the 'Audit' option.


1. Get started by navigating to your owned collection.

2. Select the ellipsis menu option to the right of the 'Edit' button in the top banner of your collection.

3. Select the 'Audit' option.

4. Select a line item in the Audit Log modal that displays.

See in this example above that user added an 'Activation kit' contributor flag.

5. Additionally, selecting another line item, we see that there was another update to the description field on August 27th at 4:54pm.

Please note, that the 'Unknown' most likely can be tied to the last username that made an update to the collection. Meaning the user was the associated update that followed in the screenshot shown above for the 'Unknown' update.

Additionally note, that there are 'System' Username updates. This can be tied to cache updates or content calls to flags that need to be updated on the front end.
