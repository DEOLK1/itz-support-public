# Collections

## Introduction to Collections -  What is a collection?
* A collection is a group of related resources that can include additional or multiple nested collections.



What does a collection look like on IBM Technology Zone? 
* Here is an example of a simple collection: [Custom ROKS & VMWare requests](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vm-ware-requests)


![collection overview](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/collection%20overview.png)

![Collection overview 2](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/collections-overview-2.png)

See on this collection that there are resources to help the end user get started with one of the following environments, like the setup guide for the VMWare Cloud adoption lab. 

**NOTE:** Collections can be customized to look more complex than this one. For example, collections with journeys.
Read the Introduction to Journeys runbook to see how owners/authors can drive a specific learning journey with their collections by ordering resources and environments into tabs that we call journeys.

* A collection can encompass resources, environments, and journeys. It can be as complex or as simple as the owner/author deems fit to make the collection based on the experience they intend to drive to the consumer of their content. 

* A collections is not limited to pointing to other additional collections from one collection. Collections can be nested within a collection and managed similar to a resource on a collection. 

Here is an example of multiple nested collections on this main collection: [Cloud Pak for Business Automation Activiation Kit](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-for-automation-activation-kit#tab-2)

**NOTE:** The box icon represents that this resource is of type collection. Hover over the box to see the type for yourself.

## Ownership Transfer

When the existing owner of a collection has an invalid IBM email (caused by separation from IBM typically) an automated job will fire an email off to all other contributors in that collection.  Whomever claims the collection first will become the new owner of the collection.

The email contributors look will look similar to below.  
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/1828/files/91158c80-462b-11ed-84d2-3a6071644a03)

If you are a contributor, you will be able to click the Update Ownership link on the bottom. Next click the accept ownership button to accept ownership of the collection.

# Automated collection lifecycle management on Technology Zone

As of today, content contributors must adhere and agree to guidelines and standards before creating and publishing any collection on IBM Technology Zone. Refer to screenshot below on terms you agreed to as a contributor to maintain consistent, accessible, and quality content is published on the site. 

(screenshot below - this pop up modal displays after select "Share your content" button)

![content guidelines](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/ccg-modal.png)

Due to the maintanence of content authors collections being a manual process today, the IBM Technology Zone team is working on a solution to automate notifications to content authors when their collections have an identified issues to resolve regarding quality standards. Below are a list of issues that our team will be automating checks for regarding content issues:

1) Collection ownership: When and if a collection owner is not longer within IBM or their is no longer active, a new author/owner should be assigned. 
2) Collection last updated date: Depending on your collections badge, different standards apply today:
   - Bronze & Silver adheres to a 90 day refresh cycle.
   - Gold adheres to a 60 day refresh cycle. 
   - Platinum adheres to a 30 day refresh cycle. 
3) Collection has proper taxonomy applied: Collections have to have valid IBM Federated catalog offerings applied for a consistent user experience searching for your content and for proper reporting offering usage metricss. 
6) Collection has an associated brand: Collection have to have a brand applied for a consistent user experience searching for your content and to ensure proper reporting offering usage metrics are captured appropiately which is reliant on this field as well.
7) Collection has been badged appropriately: Collections must have a badge associated with their collection and should be reviewed when refresh cycle approaches to ensure that your collection still meets the minimal criteria for each badge at that time. 

Why is this process being automated? As content contributors accumulate and contribute more collections the ability to manage timeframes of when updates should be made and the meta data underlying is tagged appropriately can be hard to maintain manually. We appreciate the contributions made to IBM Technology Zone, now let us help you manage it with friendly reminders and content checks. 

## What is changing: 

Emails sent to authors to remind them to update content based on content badge standards. Refer to the above list of issues that our new validation service will check regarding your content. 


## When to expect this automation: 

This automation is planned for Q3 2022. 

Please come back to this runbook for additional documentation as we have more details on this initiative. 

![validation](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/validationservice.png)

Two validation checks to expect with MVP rollout end of July. 

1. Based on badge of collection email authors if collections last updated date is more than the following per badge.
   - 30 days for Platinum
   - 60 days for Gold
   - 90 days for Silver & Bronze
2. Validate content owner is still valid. If not found in Blue Pages or within Authorization service, then email collaborators to reassign ownership.

Emails sent to authors with trigger based on once a week running validation checks on all collections on published on Technology Zone. If a collection is in a draft or retired status the validation will not occur on these collections.

## What is a Resource?
   # Resource type definitions

This runbook will explain each resource type option that content owners can share to a collection and additionally provide insight to consumers of content on how to find a specific resource type on IBM Technology Zone. 

**Main agenda of a resource on IBM Technology Zone** is a resource that leads to or supports a hands-on activity or demo. For more context, the resource needs to move the practioner forward so that it brings something real to the end user. 

Below are the resource types available to associate on your collection today based on the resource agenda above:

![Resource type definitions](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/resource%20type%20definitions.png)

Example 1: A video that walks through the hands-on demonstration is an acceptable resource to share on your collection.

Example 2: A Demo script that will help the practioner with the hands-on demonstration is an acceptable resource to share on your collection.

Example 3: A tutorial that is a step by step guide walking through a certain use case or scenario showing the hands-on activity is an acceptable resource to share on your collection.

# How do I share my environment with another user?

Share an environoment with an IBMr, a business partner, or even invite a client to access the environment. The following steps will show you how to manage your environment reservation to share with the entended user and how they will be invited to the environment per persona (IBMr, business partner, clients).

**Important - Know who can reserve each infrastructure and who you can share with:**
 
- Skytap environments: Reserved by IBMrs and Business Partners and can be shared amongst IBMrs, Business Partners, and Clients. 
- IBM Cloud environments (this includes ROKS, Hosted, SaaS options): Reserved by IBMrs and Business Partners and can be shared amongst IBMrs, Business Partners, and Clients. Ensure that the user has accepted the IBM Cloud invite or they will not be able to access the environment. The IBM Cloud invite is an email sent to the IBMid email that the owner shared the environment with. 
- AWS and Azure environments: Reserved by IBMrs and Business Partners and can be shared amongst IBMrs, Business Partners, and Clients. 
- Fyre environments: Reserved ONLY by IBMrs at this time due to VPN access. Can ONLY be shared amongst IBMrs at this time.


## How to share

6. Click on "Share" blue button.

**Important:** Once shared it can not be revoked. Only by ITZ Admins per owner request.

7. An email will then be sent to the user that yoou shared the environment with. Access credentials included in the email. 

**Important:** Not all environments trigger a shared email at this time. Shared emails will be sent with all IBM Cloud, Hosted, SaaS, AWS, and Azure environment reservations. The IBM Technology Zone team is working to integrate the Skytap, Fyre, and ROKS pipeline to have this same capability, but it is not available at this time. 

![shared template](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/shared%20template.png)

IBMrs and Partners that you shared the environment with will be able to login to IBM Technology Zone and see a reservation card on their "My reservations" page. The shared environment will have **(Shared)** next to their status field. Users that are shared the environment will not be able to extend, share, or transfer the environment. These actions are owner actions and the user that was shared the environment will need to reach out to the owner to request these actions. 

![sharee view](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/sharee%20view.png)

8. See who all you have shared this environment with right from the reservation card from "My reservations" page.

# Introduction to journeys - What is a journey? 

* A sequenced navigation implemented via tabs to better guide consumers through the collection.

What does a journey look like on a collection?

* Reference [Cloud Pak for Data collection](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-4-data) as an example.

![Collection journey example screenshot](/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/journeys-homepage.png)

* Each tab is a journey specified and created by the content owner to help drive a particular engagement or activity.
* Each journey will have its own set of resources that align based on the content owners intent of the journey

[Back to Top](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/techzone-content.md#techzone-contents-guide)


# How to create a journey
Reference the Introduction to journeys runbook to learn more about what a journey is and how to find them on a collection. 


## Before you get started

* You must first have a collection already created. Reference How to create a collection runbook.
* If you already have a collection, Reference the How to edit a collection runbook in order to add a journey. 

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: You must have resources or environments already created before adding a journey**

Reference How to create a resource and How to create an environment runbooks to get started with this process. 


## Create a Journey

1. Once on the edit collection page scroll down to the journeys section.

![Add a journey section](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/edit%20collection%20add%20journey%20section.png)

2. Select "Add a journey" button to create your first journey.

![Add a journey form](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/add%20a%20journey%20form.png)

3. Fill in the minimum required journey fields:

* **Journey title** - This will be the label you see on the tab of your collection. 

Reference the [Cloud Pak for Data collection](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-4-data) example with screenshot provided above to see the journeys created for that collection. 

* **Description** - Provide an overview of what value or end result this journey will provide to the consumer of this content.

* **Visibility** - Decide what users can see this journey. Is it just IBMr applicable? Is it specific to Business Partners? Select the necessary users that you want to be able to see this journey when visiting your collection. 

* **Status** - Make sure that enabled is set if you want this to display on your published collection. Status of disabled will remove from the public view. 

4. Now, lets associate which resources and environments that you would like to display in this collection.

* See in the bottom right hand corner of the journey edit form the resources and environments that you have created on this collection. Here is an example of what this section will look like if you have resources and environments already created. If you do not see a list of resources and collections, please reference the before you get started section above to get additional runbook support in how to add an environment or a resource on your collection. 

![Resources and environments section](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/resources%20and%20environments%20to%20choose%20from%20for%20journey%20creation.png)

* Drag and drop the resources and environments that you want on the journey tab to the right hand Journey section. 

See and end result example below of after dragging and dropping the resources and environments to the Journey section that you would like to see dispaly under this journey tab. 

![Drag and drop journey creation](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/drag%20and%20drop%20journey%20creation.png)

**Important Note:** Resources and Environments that are **NOT** associated to a Journey will be universal resources that can be found under the journeys resources. See example of where the orphaned resources and environments will display. 

![Orphaned resource](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/orphaned%20resources%20from%20journey.png)


5. Select 'Save' to capture this newly created journey. 

Wait for the Journey saved notification to display before continuing to next step. 

![Journey saved notification](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/saved%20journey%20notification1.png)

6. Navigate to the 'Preview' button at the bottom of the edit collection form to see how your new journey will display.

![Preview option](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/preview%20option.png)

7. Then proceed down to the bottom of your edit collection form to save the entire collection with this newly added journey.

![Save the collection](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/save%20the%20collection.png)

* Wait for the Collection saved notification to display before continuing. 

![Save collection notification](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/save%20collection%20notification.png)

8. **You have now created your first Journey!!**

Select the view tab at the top right hand corner of the edit collection form. If your new collection is not displaying yet, refresh your page a few times or wait a few minutes for your changes to update through the cached layer.

 # Collection Brand Filter

Learn how this filter gets populated and how to navigate to the Brand filter while on IBM Technology Zone

## How to filter content and environments by **Brand**

There are multiple search pages on IBM Technology Zone to first be made aware of, that all have the same Brand filter available for use. 

- Platinum search page with filter options: https://techzone.ibm.com/platinum

- Environments search page with filter options: https://techzone.ibm.com/environments

- Activation Kits search page with filter options: https://techzone.ibm.com/activationkits

- Experiences search page with filter options: https://techzone.ibm.com/experiences

- General ALL collections and resources search page with filter options: https://techzone.ibm.com/search

Picking the General All collections and resources search page as an example, find the Brand filter displaying first in the filter option list. 

![brand filter](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/itz/itz-runbooks/Images/brandfilter.png)

The Technology Zone team has provided an enhancement for Content Contributors while creating and modifying content to be able to select Brand from a normalized Brand list. The following Brand options will display if there are collections using this brand field.

- AI Applications

- Automation

- Data and AI

- IBM Z and LinuxONE

- Power

- Public Cloud

- Security

- Storage Systems


## How to add a Brand to a collection - content contributor specific

You noticed that your collection does not display as a Branded filtered results based on the Brand you intended it to be under. How do I go about updating my collection to be filterable from the Brand field.

Step 1. Navigate to your collection and select edit in the top right banner. 

Step 2. Scroll down to the Metadat section. Find the Brands field. 

![brand field](/itz/itz-runbooks/Images/brandfield.png)

Step 3. Select the Brand option that relates to the offering in which this collection was build to help demo. (above are the listed Brand options that you will see display)

Step 4. Save your collection and then allow time for your results to display. 

NOTE: To speed up the process, select the reindex option and then following the cache update option from your collection view page. The Reindex will force any data points that you updated on your collection to be updated within elastic search, meaning that the brand filter should be updated with the forced update. The cache update will speed up the refresh process for your collection to show the most recent version based on your changes while editing your collection.

![reindex and cache update](/itz/itz-runbooks/Images/reindexandcache.png)
