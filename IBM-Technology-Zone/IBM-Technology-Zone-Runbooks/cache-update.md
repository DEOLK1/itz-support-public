# Break through the IBM Technology Zone cache layer

IBM Technology Zone has a cache layer that will take time to display changes and updates that you have made on your collections.

**NOTE:** This was an enhancement request that the IBM Technology Zone team has acted on to provide a way for content authors and collaborators a way to display your updates faster by breaking through the chache layer. Log any ideas for enhancements you have in Aha [here](https://ibm.biz/techzone-enhancements). 

1. Navigate to your owned collection.

2. Select the ellipse option to the right of the edit button in the right hand side of the collection banner. 

3. Select the Cache update option.

4. Wait for the job to run.

5. Once the job runs it will exit the Cache buster page or you can select done. 

6. Notice your changes will now display and for others visiting your collection, it will display the most recent version for them as well.
