## VMware Published Services

Published Services allow users to expose TCP/UDP ports on VM to the Internet. 
They are commonly used to access a VM via SSH or direct RDP, or to access web or application services running on a VM.

**NOTE: You must configure the VM guest operating system and applications running on the VM to accept the remote connection**

### Environment Configuration
1. Set `ports` field in `vm_map_string`. 
Its format is `"ports": ["<port_number>/<protocol>", …]`
TCP and UDP protocols are supported

2. Add Link patterns – map VM’s internal IP:port with a link template

### Reservation
Reserve the new environment. Once completed, verify published services links for your exposed web-services in a browser

If you exposed the remote access services (RDP, VNC, or SSH), verify its direct connection with a client.
E.g. open MS Remote Desktop client and add the published service RDP link
