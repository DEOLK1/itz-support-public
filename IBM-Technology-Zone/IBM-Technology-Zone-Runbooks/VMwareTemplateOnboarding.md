# VMware template onboarding to Production
This runbook contains steps to complete Template onboarding for VMware template for TechZone. 

> Kindly note it takes 48 - 72 hours to complete, please plan accordingly

There are two ways to have your template onboarded to production
1. By Providing the vm_template_id name from your [Template to collection](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/template-an-ibm-cloud-classic-vm-for-your-collection.md) environment. (Follow this step if you are making updates from a reservation)

2. By Providing template name in folder templates-Shared (Applicable ONLY to Authors that completed Skytap migrations and have access to templates-shared folder in vcenter or Template builder access)

  All templates need to be onboarded correctly to ensure user environment provisioning do not fail. Follow steps listed below.

 - [VMware template onboarding from "Template to collection](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/VMwareTemplateOnboarding.md#vmware-template-onboarding-from-template-to-collection)

- [VMware template onboarding from "templates-shared"](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/VMwareTemplateOnboarding.md#vmware-template-onboarding-from-templates-shared)

## VMware template onboarding from "Template to collection"
Now that your Template has been successfully created it needs to be onboarded before you can update your environment configuration setting follow directions to get this completed.

Send a VMware "template onboarding request"** to the TechZone Support Team
Complete a [webform](https://ibmsf.force.com/ibminternalproducts/s/createrecord/NewCase?language=en_US) or send an email to techzone.help@ibm.com

**Subject: VMware "template copy/onboarding request"**

```
a. Collection url/ name: 

b. Environment name:

C. vm_template_id:
```

**Note:** To obtain **'vm_template_id'**, 
- click edit on the top right of your collection 
- scroll to Environment, click on edit environment
- scroll to Terraform Variables Overriding, under **name** 'vm_template_id' column **new value** you will find the associated 'vm_template_id'

It takes **2 to 3** business days to complete a template copy/onboarding request. You will be notified by the support agent when the template is available in all TechZone supported regions. 

### **Next Steps:** Update your environment configuration settings and Terraform Variables Overriding. 

* Settings
  * Preffered     
    ```
    Account Pool: itzvmware
    Cloud Account: Any
    Geo: Select preferred geo (Americas,Europe or AP)
    Region: Any
    Datacenter: Any
    Click the + sign to enter your entry
    Repeat steps to add additional Geo's 
    ```

**Terraform Variables Overriding**
 
- vm_template_folder: **templates-user**
- vm_template_id: leave as is

- Set the status to "Enabled"
- Save the environment on your collection and wait for the confirmation notification that the save was successful.
- Save the collection and wait for the confirmation notification that the save was successful.
